![Sample of Atai](sample.svg)

Atai is a bitmap font inspired by Arial and Helvetica which covers the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.

## Building

To build the font files from their sources, run `build.py`. This font requires Python 3, [FontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools), and [Bits N' Picas](https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas) (as a JAR located in the parent directory) to build.
